Adds field attributes to extension fields.
Field attributes can be added only for extension fields. Extension fields are fields which are not part of the original BO, but are added via RAP data model extension.
The following field attributes are available in BDEF extensions for extension fields:
readonly
mandatory
suppress
readonly:update
features:instance
Note: When implementing instance feature control for fields, the rules for extension ABPs apply.
